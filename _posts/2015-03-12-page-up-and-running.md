...aaand here we go! I just spend the weekend setting up the page,
there's still some information missing, but it's on its way.

The idea of this blog has been forming for some time now;
it is 
I've found web pages covering these issues to be nearly invaluable in my work; 
often times, others have already solved the issue,
or at least worked on a solution to a similar problem.
But there are always plenty of cases when, basically, you're on your own.
I've made it habit by now to take notes of just about anything I spend time on
and _might_ have to come back to at a later stage.
The result of this is a steadily growing wiki
with helpful instructions for just about anything I've been working on
for the past three years -- work-related and otherwise.
I don't think that a single week goes by without at least some updates.
Most of this information is probably useless to others than me,
but there's probably some tips in there that might be of use to others.

So that's where I'm at now,
time to start feeding some of this information back to the community.

Oh, and there will be other topics as well!
Maybe some gardening or sewing or cycling or whatever else I can think of.
But don't worry, I'll try to keep things nice and tidy,
sorting posts by a few categories.
I'm not yet sure about how the RSS will handle this,
but I'll get to that eventually.

Anyway, here we go!
