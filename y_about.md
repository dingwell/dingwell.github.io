## Hi there!
Welcome to my personal webpage and blog.
I'm not a very active blogger;
I do a lot of stuff, but I only occasionally find the time and motivation to write about it.

## About me
I'm a researcher, developer and data analyst, my main field being meteorology.
I currently work as a researcher at Uppsala University in Sweden,
but I'm on the lookout for new challenges,
so if you know of any, please let me know!

I also have a life outside work (which often means different kinds of work).
Every now and then, I get the chance to do something I really enjoy, such as:
cross country skiing, cycling, growing pumpkins, sewing historic clothing,
dressing up in historic clothing, dancing in historic clothing, picnicking in
historic clothing... On second though: sed 's/({verbs})/\1 in historic
clothing/g' this whole paragraph (and the next one).

I also gather and analyze different kinds of everyday life statistics,
build time-~~wasting~~saving household robots,
and occasionally do some scientific studies on simple things
that many take for granted
(like how much water do you actually use
when doing the dishes under the tap compared to when using the sink?)
