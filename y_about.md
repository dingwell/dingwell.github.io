## Hi there!
Welcome to my personal webpage and blog
(and sorry about the mess, this is still a work in progress).

## About me
I'm a PhD-student in Meteorology at Uppsala University, Sweden.
I work with models, I write code, and sometimes I manage to get usable results
in which case, I write about them.

I also have a life outside academia,
where I write code and sometimes manage to get good results
and write about those.
Well, I'm always working in front of a screen;
which reminds me:
I should probably stop here and get back to this some other time.
God night!
